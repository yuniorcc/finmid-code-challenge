# Finmid Challenge

### Getting Started

Within the [Makefile](Makefile) you can handle the entire flow to get everything up & running:

1. Install `make` on your computer, if you do not already have it.
2. Start the application: `make up`
3. Shut down the application: `make down`

As you could see on the [Makefile](Makefile) script and the [Docker-Compose File](docker-compose.yaml), the whole API 
and the PostgreSQL instance are containerized with Docker.
